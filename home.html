    Hello fam! The time has come again to start planning our Winter and Summer parties. We will need 
    volunteers that are able to help the host with whatever they need before, during and after the party. 
    If you have availabilty please check the Winter and Summer party tabs to get the hosts contact 
    information. This year the Winter party will be held at the Duffy household and the Summer party will be 
    at Gene and Rosie Sheas house. As usual it will be BYOB but food, water and soft drinks will be provided. 
    For more information on each party please visit either the Winter or Summer party tabs below.
